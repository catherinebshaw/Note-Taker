# Note-Taker
The note-taker provides a simple app to store and edit notes. 

## User Experience
Users navigate to the second page where they are given the opportunity to create and save a simple note. Saved notes are listed on the left side of the page. Notes can be edited or deleted as necessary. 

## Technology Used
The app uses HTML and CSS for the front end and uses the following Node Package Modules: express, fs and node-uuid to facilitate functions on the back end.  JavaScript is used throughout.
